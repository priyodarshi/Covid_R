# Covid_R
Analysis of a coronavirus dataset from Kaggle. Cleaned the dataset using R. Calculated the fatality rate, mean ages of people expired and recovered, and performed two sample t-tests to check their statistical significance and prove the hypothesis that older people are more susceptible to the virus, and that men have higher fatality rates than women. 
Made use of ggplot2 package, to plot relevant graphs.
